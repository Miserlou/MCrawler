MCrawler version 0.01
=====================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL				 --> creates make file
   make                          --> automatically checks dependencies and install required packages from CPAN
   make test					 --> tests not working need to write some
   make install					 --> avoid installing it since in development phase
   
   Creating Database
   
   createdb -W -O crawler -U crawler crawlerdb   			   --> crawler is user
   												 			   --> crawlerdb is DB name
   												 			   --> default password is 'crawler'
   
   All default database values can be changed in MCrawler_config.yml
   
   psql -f <root_dir>/MCrawler_DB.sql -U crawler -d crawlerdb  --> creates database
   
   create roles for database clients:
   login psql with super user permissions
   CREATE ROLE "client_"<client_id> WITH LOGIN PASSWORD <client_database_password> ;
   example: CREATE ROLE client_8989 WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'secret';
   
   Starting the Crawler and Server 
   
   cd <Root_directory>
   perl Crawler.PL
   
   Starting Client
   
   perl MClient.PL
   
   Client command format:
   Making new request   		 --> new_request
   Checking messages from server --> check_inbox
   Queueing a URL				 --> queue_url <request_id> <url>
   Queueing a file with URLs	 --> queue_file <request_id> <file_location>              
   Other Settings				 --> downloads_type <request_id> <user_value>			  not_used
   								 --> depth_of_search <request_id> <user_value>			  default_value -> 3
   								 --> refresh_rate <request_id> <user_value>				  default_value -> 60*60*24
   								 --> allowed_content <request_id> <user_value>			  default_value -> html|txt
   								 --> user_agent <request_id> <user_value>				  default_value -> MCrawler bot (http://cyber.law.harvard.edu)
								 --> dequeue_request <request_id>
								 --> check_status <request_id>
